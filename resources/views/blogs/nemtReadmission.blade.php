                            <h3 class="mb-3">How NEMT Reduces Hospital Readmission Rates in Southern California</h3>

                            <p>
                                Hospital readmissions are a major challenge for healthcare providers across Orange County, Los
                                Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and the broader Inland Empire. A large percentage of
                                readmissions result from patients missing scheduled follow-up appointments, lacking stable
                                transportation, or not receiving timely access to routine care such as dialysis or wound
                                management.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Reliable Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) plays an essential role in breaking
                                this cycle. By ensuring patients get to their appointments safely and consistently, NEMT reduces
                                unnecessary readmissions and supports better health outcomes.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3 text-primary">Why Patients Miss Follow-Up Appointments</h3>

                            <p>
                                Many patients across Southern California face transportation barriers that prevent them from
                                receiving the medical attention they need after being discharged. The most common reasons
                                include:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1. Limited access to transportation</strong><br>
                                    Patients without a car or family support often rely on public transportation, which can be
                                    unreliable or inaccessible for those with mobility limitations.</li>

                                <li><strong>2. Physical limitations</strong><br>
                                    Wheelchair users, patients with post-operative restrictions, or those requiring assistance cannot
                                    easily get in and out of standard vehicles.</li>

                                <li><strong>3. Distance and traffic</strong><br>
                                    Southern California’s long distances and heavy traffic make timing critical: especially for
                                    dialysis, wound care, PT/OT, or specialty appointments.</li>

                                <li><strong>4. Appointment frequencies</strong><br>
                                    Some patients require multiple visits per week. Without reliable transportation, missed
                                    appointments accumulate quickly.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Reliable NEMT prevents missed appointments, unsafe delays, and transportation-related
                                cancellations by providing:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>✔ <strong>Door-to-door assistance</strong><br>
                                    Drivers help patients from their home, into the vehicle, and safely into the medical facility.</li>

                                <li>✔ <strong>ADA-compliant vehicles</strong><br>
                                    Wheelchair vans, gurney vans, and vehicles equipped with securements ensure safety and
                                    stability.</li>

                                <li>✔ <strong>On-time arrivals and pick-ups</strong><br>
                                    NEMT providers track schedules closely to avoid delays - essential for dialysis, chemotherapy,
                                    wound care, and post-op follow-ups.</li>

                                <li>✔ <strong>Consistent scheduling</strong><br>
                                    Standing orders help repeat patients maintain regular care.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3 text-primary">The Cost Impact for Facilities & Hospitals</h3>

                            <p>When a patient misses even one critical follow-up visit, risks increase significantly:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li> Complications from chronic conditions</li>
                                <li> Emergency room visits</li>
                                <li> Unnecessary readmissions</li>
                                <li> Higher costs for facilities</li>
                                <li> Delayed recovery</li>
                                <li> Increased caregiver strain</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Reducing readmissions is not just beneficial for patient health, it directly supports facility
                                efficiency and lowers system-wide costs.
