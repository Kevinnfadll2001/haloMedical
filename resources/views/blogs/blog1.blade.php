                                        When people think of medical transportation, ambulances often come to mind.
                                        But for millions of patients across the country, there is another critical
                                        service that bridges the gap between healthcare access and mobility:
                                        <strong>Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT)</strong>.

                                        Non-Emergency Medical Transportation refers to transportation services
                                        provided to individuals who need assistance getting to medical appointments
                                        but do not require emergency care. These rides are typically scheduled in
                                        advance and used for routine healthcare visits such as:
                                    </p>

                                        Unlike ambulances, NEMT vehicles are designed for comfort, accessibility,
                                        and reliability rather than urgent medical response.

                                        As people age, driving may no longer be safe or convenient.
                                        NEMT ensures older adults can continue attending medical appointments
                                        independently and with dignity.

                                        Many insurance programs, including Medicaid, cover NEMT services,
                                        making healthcare accessible regardless of transportation limitations.

                                    <h3 class="mb_20">Why NEMT Matters in Healthcare</h3>

                                    <p class="mb_30">
                                        Missed appointments cost the U.S. healthcare system billions of dollars
                                        annually and negatively impact patient outcomes. NEMT helps reduce:

                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="mb_40">
                                        By removing transportation as a barrier, NEMT directly improves
                                        public health and quality of life.
                                    </p>
